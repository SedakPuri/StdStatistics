# StdStatistics
The "Stats.java" driver is one that generates a random array of number of a user specified length and then graphs it with accompanying descriptive statistics. The "Grapher.java" driver graphs a function on a canvas and find the integrals using Simpsons and Trapezoidal Theorems with a user specified a and b bound as well as the n segments.
